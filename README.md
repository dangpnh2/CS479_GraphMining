# CS479_GraphMining

## Dependencies:
* networkx
* keras (for DNGR)
* gensim (for baselines)
* karateclub (for Grarep)

## Baseline word embeddings:
To run the baseline, first you need to run the download.ipynb to download all  pretrained models.
Source code for word2vec, glove and fasttext for text classification and clustering can be found in w2v_glove_fasttext.ipynb.

## Graph-based models:

* Grarep: The experiment results for Grarep can be obtained from Grarep.ipynb.
* DNGR: The experiment results for Grarep can be obtained from graph_DNGR.ipynb (I adopted the source code from https://github.com/apoorvavinod/DNGR)
